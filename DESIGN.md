# Design System: Kynd

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Instrument Panel"**

Kynd is a precise research instrument, not a dashboard. Like the cockpit of a high-end microscope or the control surface of a recording console, every element exists because it serves a function. The interface is a clear lens between the user and the behavioral data — when it works well, the user forgets it's there.

**Personality:** Sharp, confident, minimal. The visual system takes cues from Notion's editorial clarity, Arc's spatial conviction, and Raycast's keyboard-first precision. Warmth comes from craft, not from ornamentation.

This system explicitly rejects the Generic AI SaaS aesthetic — no gradient heroes, no glass-morphism cards, no hero-metric template, no decorative blur as default surface treatment. Color is rare and purposeful. Surfaces are flat. Motion is mechanical, not playful.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dark mode primary, light mode secondary — the instrument lives in dim rooms at late hours
- One accent color (cerulean blue) used on ≤10% of any screen; its rarity is the point
- Flat surfaces with crisp, thin borders — no shadows at rest
- Snappy, mechanical motion — 150ms transitions, expo easing, zero bounce
- Typographic hierarchy driven by weight and scale contrast, not color

## 2. Colors

A restrained palette built around cool charcoal neutrals and a single cerulean blue accent. The strategy is deliberate scarcity: the accent exists to direct attention, not to decorate.

### Primary (Dark Mode — Primary Expression)

- **Instrument Charcoal** (`oklch(0.12 0.01 265)`): Background. Deep cool charcoal with a faint blue tilt — never pure black.
- **Panel Surface** (`oklch(0.14 0.01 265)`): Card and elevated surface backgrounds. One step above background, distinguishable by lightness, not shadow.
- **Raised Surface** (`oklch(0.16 0.01 265)`): Secondary surfaces, sidebar, hovered cards.
- **Cerulean Blue** (`oklch(0.62 0.2 230)`): Primary accent. A warm cerulean blue used sparingly for interactive elements, active states, and data highlights. Never decorative.
- **Instrument White** (`oklch(0.95 0 0)`): Primary text, headings, high-importance labels.
- **Instrument Grey** (`oklch(0.65 0.01 265)`): Secondary text, metadata, placeholders.
- **Panel Edge** (`oklch(0.2 0.01 265)`): Borders and dividers. Thin, crisp, present but not dominant.

### Primary (Light Mode — Secondary Expression)

- **Instrument White** → `oklch(0.97 0.005 265)`: Background in light mode. Cool off-white.
- **Panel Surface** → `oklch(0.94 0.005 265)`: Card backgrounds.
- **Instrument Charcoal** → `oklch(0.14 0.01 265)`: Text in light mode.
- **Cerulean Blue** → `oklch(0.57 0.2 230)`: Primary accent, slightly deeper to maintain contrast on light backgrounds.
- **Panel Edge** → `oklch(0.85 0.01 265)`: Borders in light mode.

### Semantic Colors

- **Alert Red** (`oklch(0.58 0.2 28)`): Destructive actions, errors, critical signals.
- **Caution** (`oklch(0.76 0.14 24)`): Negative information that isn't an error — model uncertainty, low-confidence outputs, "less reliable for" labels. Visually softer than Alert Red; reads as caution, not danger.
- **Cerulean Blue (low opacity)** (`oklch(0.62 0.2 230 / 0.12)`): User chat bubbles, selection highlights, active filter backgrounds. The accent color applied as a tint rather than a solid.

### Named Rules

**The Rarity Rule.** The accent (Cerulean Blue) occupies no more than 10% of any given screen. Its scarcity is what gives it power. If a screen feels colorful, the rule is broken.

**The No-Black Rule.** Never use `#000` or `rgb(0,0,0)`. Every dark surface has chromatic temperature. Charcoal carries a faint blue tilt because the brand hue lives in the cool blue-violet range, not because "dark mode = desaturated black."

**The Flat-Edge Rule.** Borders are thin (`1px`) and present. They separate surfaces so shadows don't have to. If a border is doing its job, a shadow isn't needed.

## 3. Typography

**Display & Body Font:** Geist Sans (with system-ui, sans-serif fallback)
**Mono/Label Font:** Geist Mono (with ui-monospace, monospace fallback)

**Character:** Sharp, technical, and unapologetically typographic. This is a single-family system with distinct expression: Geist Sans carries all interface text, Geist Mono owns data, code, and labels. The contrast between Sans and Mono creates the hierarchy at the type level.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (600, `clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4.5rem)`, 1.1, `-0.03em`): Hero headlines and marketing landing titles only. Never used inside the app dashboard.
- **Headline** (600, `clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2.25rem)`, 1.2, `-0.02em`): Section headers in the app, page titles, modal headers.
- **Title** (500, `1.125rem`, 1.4, `-0.01em`): Card titles, persona names, feature headings.
- **Body** (400, `0.9375rem`, 1.6): Primary reading text. Line length capped at 70ch.
- **Label — Mono** (500, `0.6875rem`, 1, `0.08em`, uppercase): Data labels, metric names, badge text, metadata. Always Geist Mono, always uppercase.
- **Mono** (400, `0.8125rem`, 1.5): Code snippets, numeric data, chat messages.

### Named Rules

**The Mono-Data Rule.** All quantitative data — scores, metrics, timestamps, tokens — renders in Geist Mono with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`. Numbers must align in tables and lists.

**The Single-Family Rule.** No mixing display fonts with body fonts. Geist Sans carries everything. Hierarchy comes from weight, size, and the Sans-vs-Mono switch, not from font changes.

## 4. Elevation

Flat by default. This system does not use box-shadows to convey surface hierarchy. Depth is communicated exclusively through tonal layering (lightness steps between surfaces) and thin border presence.

- **Level 0** — Background (`oklch(0.12 0.01 265)`)
- **Level 1** — Card / Panel Surface (`oklch(0.14 0.01 265)`) + Panel Edge border
- **Level 2** — Raised Surface / Sidebar (`oklch(0.16 0.01 265)`) + Panel Edge border
- **Level 3** — Modal / Popover / Dialog: Panel Surface with backdrop dim (`rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`)

### Named Rules

**The No-Shadow Rule.** No `box-shadow` at rest. If a surface needs to separate from another, use a lightness step + a thin border. Shadows are prohibited as a layout tool. The only exception is interactive hover states on primary action elements, which may use a very subtle blue ambient glow (`0 0 0 2px oklch(0.62 0.2 230 / 0.2)`) as a focus indicator.

## 5. Components

### Buttons

**Button Hierarchy (Primary → Secondary → Ghost):** Every button in the UI must clearly belong to one of three tiers. The visual difference between tiers must be unmistakable — two buttons in the same action group must not look like they belong to different families. Mixing styles within a tier creates visual noise.

- **Shape:** Crisp 6px radius (`rounded.md`). No pill shapes — those belong on consumer surfaces.
- **Primary** (one per viewport max — chat buttons are the exception): Cerulean Blue (`bg-primary`) fill, Instrument White text. Distinguished by a subtle `ring-1 ring-primary/20` for depth. Hover: `bg-primary/90` (slightly darker fill, no shift). Transition: all 150ms `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. No scale, no lift. Primary buttons are rare — reserved for the single most important action on screen, plus "Chat with" buttons which are intentionally elevated to primary to signal interactivity.
- **Secondary** (preferred default for paired actions): `bg-card` fill with `1px border border-border/60`, Foreground text. Hover: `bg-muted/30`. This integrates with the card surface it sits on — it feels planted, not floating. Transition: colors 150ms. Used for non-primary actions in action bars, card footers, and dialog rows. Pairs of buttons use Primary + Secondary, never Primary + Primary.
- **Ghost:** Transparent fill, no border, Muted Foreground text. Hover: Foreground text. Used for icon-only buttons, inline toolbar actions, and sidebar items.
- **Padding:** `12px 24px` (standard), `8px 16px` (compact/icon), `10px 20px` (within data-heavy layouts).

**Notes on the Ring:** The `ring-1 ring-primary/20` on primary buttons exists purely to add a hair of definition to the blue fill — it prevents the button from looking like a floating color blob on dark surfaces. It is not a glow, not a shadow, not interactive feedback. The ring is part of the button's static shape, not an interaction cue.

### Cards

- **Corner Style:** 8px radius (`rounded.lg`) — gently curved, not sharp.
- **Background:** Panel Surface (`oklch(0.14 0.01 265)`).
- **Border:** Panel Edge, `1px`, full perimeter. No side-stripe borders — prohibited.
- **Shadow:** None at rest. None on hover. If hover feedback is needed, use border illumination (Panel Edge → `oklch(0.25 0.01 265)`).
- **Internal Padding:** 24px (`spacing.5`). May be reduced to 16px in data-dense grid layouts.

### Persona Card (Batch Grid)

The persona card is a **browse-and-triage surface, not a profile.** It carries only what helps a user decide which persona to inspect, chat with, or run an analysis against. Psychographic detail — Big Five bars, values, fears, backstory — belongs in the detail sheet/modal, never on the card.

- **Structure:** identity row (avatar, name, occupation, optional "Variant of") → hairline divider (`h-px bg-border/40`) → labeled detail groups → action row (`Create Variant`, `Chat with …`).
- **Identity text:** name and occupation **wrap** onto as many lines as needed (`break-words`) — never truncated. The full role must stay readable; the card grows to fit rather than clipping with an ellipsis. Long unbroken tokens break rather than overflow.
- **Detail groups:** goals (capped at 3) and the decision style. Each group is introduced by a micro-label so the values explain themselves.
- **Goals:** a labeled **bulleted list**, one goal per row, 13px `leading-snug`, with a small accent dot marker (`size-1 rounded-full bg-primary/70`). Not chips — a list is a list. The dot is the detail block's only accent touch; the action row's Chat button remains the card's primary accent.
- **Decision style:** labeled **"How they decide"**, 13px `leading-relaxed`, clamped to 3 lines. The pronoun is neutral because `Persona` carries no gender field; a gendered label would require a new entity field and generation output.
- **Micro-label:** 10px, bold, uppercase, `tracking-widest`, Muted Foreground at 70% — a de-emphasized step below the Label typography.
- **Height economy:** the card must stay scannable in a grid. Cap goals at 3, clamp the decision line, pin the action row with `mt-auto`, and rely on grid stretch so sibling cards match height.
- **Delete affordance:** hover-reveal destructive button — see Destructive Actions.
- **Rationale:** a narrative hook (backstory pull-quote) was evaluated for this card and rejected — quotes read as decorative and carry no decision signal. Decision-relevant facts (goals, how they decide) win on a triage surface; narrative belongs in the detail view.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Style:** Transparent background, Panel Edge `1px` full border, 6px radius.
- **Focus:** Panel Edge is replaced with Cerulean Blue `1px` border + very subtle ambient glow (`0 0 0 2px oklch(0.62 0.2 230 / 0.15)`). No ring offset.
- **Padding:** `10px 14px` vertical/horizontal.
- **Placeholder:** Muted Foreground at `oklch(0.50 0.01 265)`.
- **Error:** Alert Red border. Error text in Alert Red at Label size.
- **Disabled:** Full opacity at 0.4. No special background change.

### Dropdown Menus

- **Background:** Panel Surface with a subtle border (`1px border-border`), `6px` radius, shadow only on open (`shadow-md`).
- **Item Hover:** Raised Surface background (`accent` / `oklch(0.22 0.008 265)` in dark mode). **Never Cerulean Blue** — the accent color is reserved for primary actions and data highlights, not hover feedback.
- **Item Focus (keyboard):** Same as hover — tonal surface shift, not color.
- **Item Text:** Foreground at rest, Muted Foreground for disabled/secondary text.
- **Icons:** Muted Foreground, no color shift on hover.
- **Separator:** Thin `1px` line using Panel Edge, inset with padding.

### Navigation / Primary Nav

The dashboard has **no sidebar.** One destination list (Personas, Interviews, Analyses) renders in two placements so their labels and active states cannot drift. A wordmark-only bar sitting above a bottom tab bar reads as a broken header, so the two placements never appear together.

- **`lg` and up:** a floating **top bar**, sticky to the top, with the wordmark and the three destinations.
- **Below `lg` (tablet and phone):** a fixed **bottom tab bar** only. The top bar is not rendered at all below `lg`.
- **Breakpoint:** the switch is `lg`, not `sm`, so a tablet keeps the bottom bar instead of regaining the crowded top bar.

**Top bar (`lg` and up)**
- **Placement:** sticky to the top (`top-0`, `z-40`), inset from the viewport edges (`px-4 pt-4 lg:px-6`).
- **Surface:** Panel Surface at `bg-card/70`, `backdrop-blur-xl`, full `2px` Panel Edge border (`border-2 border-border/60`), `8px` radius. The extra pixel keeps the floating bar legible against the page; a 1px edge is too easy to miss. This translucent blur is the one sanctioned exception to the No-Glassmorphism rule: the bar is overlay chrome, not a content surface.
- **Items:** `6px` radius, `px-3 py-1.5`, `text-sm`. At rest Muted Foreground; hover `bg-secondary/50` + Foreground; active `bg-primary/10` + Cerulean Blue text. No horizontal scroll: at `lg` the three fit.

**Bottom tab bar (below `lg`)**
- **Placement:** fixed to the bottom edge (`inset-x-0 bottom-0`, `z-40`), with bottom padding for the safe-area inset.
- **Surface:** Panel Surface at `bg-card/90`, a `1px` top Panel Edge border, and the same sanctioned `backdrop-blur-xl` as the top bar.
- **Items:** three equal-width tabs (`flex-1`), icon above label, centred.
- **Clearance:** content carries `pb-28` below `lg` so the last row clears the bar; the floating "Run Analysis" CTA sits at `bottom-24` below `lg` to clear it too.

- **Back navigation:** inside a batch, a **left-aligned** `← All personas` control sits above the title and returns to the batch list; selecting Personas in the nav does the same. Back affordances live on the left, above the content, never as a text link parked on the right.
- **Batch reset:** selecting "Personas" clears the active batch, so the batch list is always reachable, from any section and any viewport.
- **Width:** both placements cap at `max-w-7xl` and centre; the main column shares the same cap.

### Selection States / Toggle Groups

Selection states (segmented controls, option toggles, count selectors, filter chips) use tonal hierarchy, not color, to indicate the active item. The accent color is reserved for primary actions — using it for selected-in-a-group state would violate the Rarity Rule.

- **Selected:** Raised Surface background (`muted` / `oklch(0.18 0.01 265)`), Foreground text (`oklch(0.95 0 0)`), Panel Edge border (`oklch(0.2 0.01 265)`). The background step up from the surrounding surface is enough to signal "this one is active" without introducing a second blue element.
- **Unselected:** Transparent background, Muted Foreground text (`oklch(0.65 0.01 265)`), Panel Edge border (`oklch(0.2 0.01 265)`). Hover elevates text to Foreground and border to a lighter step.
- **Implementation:** `bg-muted text-foreground border-border` for selected, `bg-transparent text-muted-foreground border-border hover:text-foreground hover:border-border/80` for unselected.

This applies to all segmented toggle groups, option rows, and count selectors across the app. The principle: selected state is communicated by a surface lightness step, never by the accent color alone.

### Chips / Badges / Tags

- **Style:** 4px radius, Panel Surface background at `oklch(0.18 0.01 265)`. Metadata badges use the Label typography (Geist Mono, uppercase, 11px); scannable tag chips use Geist Sans at 13px minimum (see the size floor below).
- **Color Variants:** Cerulean Blue text for active/selected states. Muted Foreground for neutral. Alert Red text for warning/error.
- **Padding:** `4px 10px`.

**The Tag-Not-Content Rule.** Chips are for short, low-stakes tags (interests, filters, status). They are **never** the presentation for primary content lists — goals, values, fears, domains, expertise. Wrapping a content list in pills reads as decoration ("cards just to use cards"), not design. If the values matter, render them as a labeled list (see Labeled Value Groups).

When chips are used, they must be readable and unclipped:

- **Size floor:** 13px minimum. The 11px Label size is for metadata, not for scannable tag text.
- **Sizing:** content-sized. No fixed `max-width` — a fixed cap forces mid-word truncation and awkward wrapping. Let the chip grow; let the row wrap on word boundaries.
- **Never truncate** chip text. If a chip can't fit its content, it isn't a chip — it's a list row.

### Destructive Actions (Delete / Close)

- **Style:** Small circle (`size-6 rounded-full`) with `XIcon` (`size-3.5`), positioned absolutely at `-top-2 -right-2` on the parent container.
- **Color:** Alert Red background at 90% opacity (`bg-destructive/90`), Instrument White text (`text-destructive-foreground`).
- **Visibility:** Hidden at rest (`opacity-0`), revealed on parent group hover (`group-hover:opacity-100`) with 150ms opacity transition.
- **Hover:** Full opacity red (`hover:bg-destructive`).
- **Parent:** The parent container must have `group relative` classes to enable the hover reveal.
- **Usage:** Used on cards, list items, and tags where deletion is a secondary action. The button must never be visible at rest — it only appears when the user is actively engaging with the item.

### Edit Mode Fields

Edit mode fields are inputs that appear when the user explicitly enters an editing state. They replace static text while maintaining spatial stability — the layout doesn't shift, only the display changes.

- **Style:** Tinted background at `bg-muted/30`, no visible border at rest. The tint signals editability without the visual weight of a full bordered input.
- **Focus:** `1px` Cerulean Blue border replaces the transparent border, paired with a very subtle blue ambient glow (`0 0 0 2px oklch(0.62 0.2 230 / 0.15)`). The border animates in at 150ms — the field appears to define itself only when the user interacts with it.
- **Transition:** All edit fields transition colors 150ms `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.
- **Multi-line fields** (goals, interests, values, fears): Same tinted background, `border-0` at rest with `resize-y`. Focus reveals the same blue border + glow. Placeholders show real examples rather than generic instructions.
- **Relation to static Inputs:** Edit mode fields differ from standard Inputs (which always have a Panel Edge border) — they only reveal their border on focus, making the rest state feel closer to the surrounding text.

## 6. Patterns

### Labeled Value Groups

Any set of values shown on a card or panel — goals, values, fears, interests, domains, expertise — must be introduced by a label. **Unlabeled value rows and orphan chips are prohibited:** the user cannot tell what they represent, so the data becomes noise.

- **Label:** micro-label above the group — 10px, bold, uppercase, `tracking-widest`, Muted Foreground at 70%. A de-emphasized step below the Label typography; it orients without competing with the content.
- **Content lists:** bulleted rows — a small accent dot marker, one value per row, 13px `leading-snug`. Use this for anything the user must actually read (goals, values, fears).
- **Tag sets:** only genuinely low-stakes tags may go inline or as chips (see The Tag-Not-Content Rule).
- **Pronouns:** labels that need a pronoun use the neutral "they" — `Persona` has no gender field, and guessing from a name risks misgendering.
- **Rationale:** the label is the difference between a designed element and a pile of values. An unlabeled chip row reads as decoration; a labeled group reads as intent.

### Deliberate Diff

When presenting AI-inferred changes alongside original values, the interface must communicate what changed, let the user evaluate each change independently, and provide bulk actions for confidence.

This pattern has three layers:

**Layer 1 — Visual Diff:** Every value pair (suggested vs original) is displayed as two stacked lines. The winning value (what will be applied if confirmed) is bold. The losing value is struck through at reduced opacity (`text-muted-foreground/40`). Color reinforces the distinction: the winning value renders in Cerulean Blue (`text-primary`) when it's the new suggestion, and standard Foreground when it's the original. If suggested and original are identical, no diff is shown — the value appears once with no styling.

**Layer 2 — Per-Item Decision:** Each diffs row has its own Keep/Apply toggle. The toggles are `opacity-0` at rest and revealed on row hover (`group-hover:opacity-100`), keeping the UI clean until the user engages. The selected state uses `bg-primary/10 text-primary` for Apply and `bg-muted text-foreground` for Keep. Unselected uses `bg-transparent text-muted-foreground/60 hover:text-foreground hover:bg-muted/30`. The transition is 150ms.

- **Implementation:** `DiffRow` component. Each row has `hover:bg-muted/20 transition-colors` for subtle row-level hover feedback. Toggle buttons use the `DiffToggle` sub-component to maintain consistent sizing and interaction.
- **Visual structure on each row:**
  ```
  Label (left)          [ suggested ]    [ Keep ] [ Apply ]
                        [ original ]          ← revealed on hover
  ```

**Layer 3 — Bulk Shortcuts:** Two links at the top of the diff section — "Accept all" and "Reject all" — set every item's decision at once. These are faint (`text-muted-foreground/60`) to stay out of the way, with hover bringing them to full foreground. They sit to the right of the section header.

**Decision footer:** Two buttons at the bottom of any decision dialog:
- **Primary** ("Apply selections"): Applies all items where Apply is selected. Disabled when nothing is selected.
- **Secondary** ("Keep originals"): Discards all suggestions and keeps everything as-is.

### Required-Decision Dialogs

When an action has irreversible downstream effects (e.g., an LLM call inferred new values that must either be accepted or rejected), the dialog must force a decision. There is no escape hatch.

- **No X button** in the header. `showCloseButton={false}` hides the Radix close button.
- **No overlay dismiss.** `onOpenChange` is a no-op (`() => {}`). Clicking the backdrop or pressing Escape does nothing.
- **Escape routes:** Only the two decision buttons at the bottom — "Apply selections" (primary) and "Keep originals" (secondary).
- **Visual:** Standard dialog chrome (Panel Surface, Panel Edge border, backdrop dim). The header shows the action icon + title. No close affordance.
- **Loading state:** When the dialog opens before the data is ready (e.g., waiting for an LLM call), it shows a centered spinner (`LoaderIcon` with `animate-spin`) and a descriptive text. The title changes to reflect the loading state. No decision UI is shown until the data arrives.

### Hover-Reveal Actions

Actions that are secondary to the primary interaction are hidden at rest and revealed on row/card hover. This keeps the interface clean while making actions available exactly where they're needed.

- **Visibility:** `opacity-0` at rest, `group-hover:opacity-100` on hover, 150ms opacity transition.
- **Container:** The parent element must have `group` class. The action element receives `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-150`.
- **Usage:** Per-row toggles in diff dialogs, delete buttons on cards, inline actions in list items.
- **Rationale:** Prevents visual noise while keeping actions one hover away. The user can scan the entire interface without being distracted by controls they don't need yet.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** let surfaces separate by lightness alone — one OKLCH step between background, card, and raised surface is enough.
- **Do** use Cerulean Blue sparingly: one element per viewport at most. If your eye lands on two blue elements, remove one.
- **Do** render all numeric data in Geist Mono with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- **Do** use borders (thin, `1px`, Panel Edge) to define surface boundaries.
- **Do** keep transitions at 150ms with `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — snappy, no bounce, no drift.
- **Do** use backdrop dim (`rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`) as the only elevation cue for modals and dialogs.
- **Do** label every group of values so it explains itself — an unlabeled row of values is noise.
- **Do** keep browse cards (persona grid) to decision-relevant facts: who they are, what they want, how they decide. Detail lives one click away.

### Don't:

- **Don't** use box-shadows to convey depth. Flat surfaces with tonal separation are the only elevation system.
- **Don't** use gradient text (`background-clip: text` with a gradient) anywhere — decorative and meaningless. Emphasize with weight or size.
- **Don't** use side-stripe borders (border-left >1px as an accent on cards or list items). Use full perimeter borders or nothing.
- **Don't** use glassmorphism (backdrop blur + semi-transparency) as a default surface treatment. The floating top bar is the sole exception — see Navigation / Top Bar.
- **Don't** use pill-shaped buttons. Radius stays at 6px for interactive elements.
- **Don't** use bounce easing or elastic transitions. Everything should feel mechanical and precise.
- **Don't** use the hero-metric template (big number, small label, gradient, supporting stats) — it is the Generic AI SaaS calling card.
- **Don't** use identical card grids where every card has the same icon + heading + text structure.
- **Don't** reach for a modal as the first interaction pattern. Exhaust inline panels, side sheets, and progressive disclosure first.
- **Don't** use color as the sole differentiator for any state or action — always pair with text, icon, or position.
- **Don't** render content lists (goals, values, fears, expertise) as chips or pills — that is decoration, not design. Use a labeled list.
- **Don't** leave value groups unlabeled, and don't truncate chip or list text mid-word.
- **Don't** put dense psychographic controls (Big Five bars, trait sliders, value/fear lists) on browse cards — reserve them for the detail sheet/modal.
- **Don't** truncate persona names or roles (or any identifying label) with an ellipsis — let them wrap. The user must be able to read the whole title.
- **Don't** reintroduce a persistent sidebar — dashboard navigation lives in the floating top bar, and the main column keeps the full width.
- **Don't** park back/navigation affordances on the right as an underlined text link — put them on the left, above the content, with an arrow.
- **Don't** reference the old design system. This document supersedes all prior visual guidance.
