    thoughts: "Linear's pricing model is refreshing and aligns well with our current growth phase. The 'Business' tier at $16/user/month seems like the sweet spot for a scaling startup, especially since it offers unlimited teams and guests. I'm particularly interested in the 'Triage Intelligence' and 'Issue SLAs'—those are the kind of operational efficiencies that justify the jump from $10 to $16.\n\nHowever, I'm already mentally calculating the burn as we scale from 10 to 50 engineers. $800/month is manageable, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the value we get from specifically the 'Insights' and 'Asks' features. The 'Enterprise' wall is a bit intimidating, but the transparency on the first three tiers builds a lot of trust.",

Overall, it feels like a tool built by product people for product people. The value is clear."

    thoughts: "The technical vibe of this page is perfect. It's high-contrast, no-fluff, and the feature list is granular. For my client projects, the 'Free' tier is actually robust enough to get started without hitting a wall in 2 weeks. $10 for unlimited issues is exactly what I need to see—no artificial caps on the core utility of the product.\n\nI like that billing 'Yearly' is the default but 'Monthly' is visible (implied or toggle-able). The 'Admin roles' coming in at the $10 tier is great for handoffs to my clients. My main gripe is usually missing features in the middle tiers, but Linear seems to have balanced the 'Business' features well. I'd definitely recommend this over Jira for a greenfield project.",

At $16/user, I'm expecting a much higher level of dedicated support than what's mentioned here. It says 'Support' is available, but it doesn't shout 'White Glove' until you reach the Enterprise tier.\n\nThe 'Free' tier being 'Unlimited members' is a red flag for me—how do they make money then? I worry about the stability of 'freemium' tools that are this generous. Also, the lack of a clear 'Customer Success Manager' mentioned in the lower tiers makes me nervous about the onboarding burden for my department. I'd need a demo before I could ever pitch this to my VP.",
