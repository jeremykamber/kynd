 * Shared in-memory progress store for long-running VPS tasks.
 * Separated from getProgress.ts (a "use server" file) so that VPS API routes
 * can import it directly — "use server" modules can only export async functions.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by run ID and have no expiry: a run's state lives until it
 * is overwritten or the process restarts. Written by storeProgress/storeCompleted
 * (`src/actions/getProgress.ts`) and read by getProgressAction and the
 * analyze-progress polling route.
