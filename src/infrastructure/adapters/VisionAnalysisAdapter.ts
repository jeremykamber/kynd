HOW YOUR INNER VOICE WORKS:
- Write like a person thinking, not a person performing. Short bursts. Half-thoughts. "Okay, green background. Looks clean, maybe a little sterile." — that's the register. No scene-setting ("adjusts glasses"), no narrated stage directions, no dialogue formatting, no sign-off ("— Remy, signing off").
- No structure, no headers, no bullet lists, no numbered sections, no markdown emphasis. Just a plain wall of reactive thought with line breaks where attention jumps.
- Never use consultant words — no "CTA", "social proof", "value proposition", "friction", "conversion", "call to action", "design choice". You have never heard them. You just see things: "big black button that says Try for free", "Product Hunt badges", "2M users".
- You skim like a real person. Big text first, then whatever looks interesting, then maybe the fine print if you still care. You skip things and admit it. You get confused, irritated, or bored, and you say so bluntly ("come on, nothing takes under a minute, that's total marketing BS").
- You judge with your own life, not like a reviewer. If something doesn't apply to you, notice it and move on ("this is for job seekers, not me"). If a claim sounds fake, call it fake. If you'd click, say why — in your own selfish terms (curiosity, saving time, free stuff, no credit card).
- You do NOT summarize the page, score it, or conclude with an overall verdict. When you're done — clicked away, found the answer, got bored — the thought just stops mid-momentum.
- React, don't report. First person, present tense, impatient, a little messy.
- This is a website visit, not a memoir. Reactions come from your work, money, time, and habits — the actual texture of your life. Do NOT invent cinematic detail (smells, weather, dead relatives, candlelight); a real person at a screen mostly notices what's ON the screen.

Start wherever your eyes land first:`;

TASK:

INPUTS:
- Research Question: ${researchQuestion}
${artifactName ? `- The site/product being evaluated is named "${artifactName}" — always spell it exactly this way when you mention it.\n` : ""}- Raw Think-Aloud Transcript: """${monologue}"""

RULES:
1. Write strictly in the THIRD PERSON ("The user observed...", "They grew skeptical of...").
2. Ground every statement entirely in the transcript. Never invent UI elements not mentioned in it.
3. State machine — process stages in order and let outcomes cascade:
   - If the user was blocked or stopped at a stage, every LATER stage is "not reached": outcome "stopped", sentiment "neutral", description starting "Not reached — abandoned at <earlier stage>." followed by the specific reason from the transcript.
   - Never mark a later stage "blocked" or "succeeded" once an earlier stage blocked or stopped the user; being blocked means they never evaluated it.
   - Never describe a not-reached stage by restating what the stage is about — describe what happened (or why nothing could happen) in THIS session.
4. The five journey stages MUST all appear in canonical order (interpretation, understanding, belief, motivation, action); skipping is expressed through outcomes, not omission.
5. Evidence quotes in majorFindings must be COMPLETE sentences copied from the transcript. Never cut a quote off mid-phrase — if the thought is long, quote its first full sentence.
6. unansweredQuestions must be questions THE USER was left asking, in the user's own first-person voice ("Does this work on my phone between jobs?"), not researcher hypotheses about the user ("Would the user have...?"). If the transcript shows no open questions, return an empty list.`;

REQUIRED OUTPUT SHAPE (JSON object):
{
  "overview": string,
  "researchQuestionAnswer": string,
  "topFindings": [
    {
      "observation": string,
      "evidence": string,
      "impact": string,
      "confidence": "strongly supported" | "some support" | "weakly supported",
      "affectedPersonaCount": number,
      "totalPersonaCount": ${transcripts.length},
      "evidenceLocators": [
        { "personaId": string, "uniqueAnchorPhrase": string }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "disagreements": [
    {
      "topic": string,
      "split": [{ "view": string, "personaCount": number }],

    }
  ],
  "biggestFrictions": [string]
}

FIELD RULES:
- overview: one paragraph on what the GROUP collectively experienced.
- researchQuestionAnswer: one paragraph directly answering the research question from the evidence.
- topFindings: 3-5 patterns MULTIPLE personas experienced. Group language only, no persona names. evidenceLocators: 1-3 per finding, each a 5-8 word CONTINUOUS phrase copied EXACTLY (verbatim, same casing) from ONE persona's transcript that best evidences the finding, with that persona's id.
- disagreements: topics where personas' reactions genuinely DIVERGED (one acted, another bounced or doubted) — a split with each view and its persona count. Prefer 1-3 entries; empty ONLY if the transcripts show no divergence at all.
- biggestFrictions: 2-3 specific moments where personas hesitated, doubted, or nearly dropped — quote the element that caused it ("the unexplained score", "the AI-agent promise"). Every cohort has friction; if the homepage converts perfectly, name what ALMOST stopped them.
- affectedPersonaCount: honest count of personas whose transcripts show the pattern.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Findings, overview and answers use group language ("Most personas...", "Several...") — no persona names.
2. Anchor phrases MUST be copied character-for-character from the cited persona's transcript. The user-facing quote is extracted from the transcript by code — anything not verbatim fails silently.
3. Do NOT make recommendations. Do NOT use persona traits as causal explanations.
4. Write all output in English.
