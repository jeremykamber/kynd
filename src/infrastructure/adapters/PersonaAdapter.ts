COUNT ENFORCEMENT:
- You MUST return EXACTLY ${personaCount} persona objects in the JSON array — no more, no fewer.
- Before returning, count the personas in your array. If it is not exactly ${personaCount}, adjust before responding.
- Do NOT pad with filler personas. If you find yourself generating a duplicate or low-effort persona, replace it with a genuinely distinct one.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- BIG FIVE ROOT CAUSES: Assign high-fidelity Big Five scalars (0-100). These are the "genes" of the persona.
- PRICING CALIBRATION: Derive pricingSensitivity and typicalBudget from the persona's Big Five, role, and the target market description. A well-funded VP of Engineering at a Series B will have very different expectations than a bootstrapped indie developer. This calibration MUST be consistent with their other psychographics.
- DOMAIN EXPERTISE: Generate 2-4 relevant domains based on the persona's role and the target market.
- CONSCIENTIOUSNESS: High=Meticulous/reads everything; Low=Chaotic/skips details.
- NEUROTICISM: High=Risk-averse/anxious about contract traps; Low=Bold/adventuresome.
- OPENNESS: High=Early adopter/curious about new tools; Low=Traditional/sticks with what works.
- EXTRAVERSION: High=Collaborative/seeks peer input; Low=Independent/self-directed.
- AGREEABLENESS: High=Trusting/takes recommendations; Low=Skeptical/challenges claims.
- VALUES + FEARS: These drive motivation. Must align with Big Five and pricing calibration.
- DISTRIBUTION: Ensure the ${personaCount} personas represent a spectrum across Big Five, pricing sensitivity, and decision styles.
- REALISM: Occupations, budgets, and goals must match the description.

Return ONLY valid JSON without explanatory text or markdown code blocks.`;

REFERENCE PERSONA (use as template for context, occupation, domain):
${JSON.stringify(referencePersona, null, 2)}

TARGET BIG FIVE VALUES (adjusted by user - your generated personas must use EXACTLY these values):
- Conscientiousness: ${adjustments.bigFive.conscientiousness}
- Neuroticism: ${adjustments.bigFive.neuroticism}
- Openness: ${adjustments.bigFive.openness}
- Extraversion: ${adjustments.bigFive.extraversion}
- Agreeableness: ${adjustments.bigFive.agreeableness}

VARIATION LEVEL: ${adjustments.variationLevel}/100
- LOW variation (0-30): Keep occupation, education level, and thematic domain similar to the reference persona. Generate new backstory, values, fears, goals, interests, communication style, and decision style that align with the adjusted Big Five.
- MEDIUM variation (31-70): Moderate changes to occupation and life context. The reference serves as loose inspiration.
- HIGH variation (71-100): Full creative freedom. Only the adjusted Big Five values are fixed. Occupation, background, and story can be entirely new while remaining in the same product/market domain.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The Big Five values you output MUST match the TARGET values above exactly.
- All other fields (values, fears, goals, interests, backstory, etc.) must be INTERNALLY CONSISTENT with the adjusted Big Five profile.
- DISTRIBUTION: Each variation should be a distinct persona, not a copy of the reference.
- CREATIVE BACKSTORIES: Each persona needs a compelling 3-5 paragraph first-person backstory that causally explains how their life experiences shaped their Big Five profile.
- AI INSIGHT: A sharp 2-sentence insight into their primary motivation and biggest psychological barrier.
- REALISM: Occupations, budgets, and goals must feel authentic and market-appropriate.
