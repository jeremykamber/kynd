 * rationales grounded in psychological scaffolds (Big Five, Primal World
 * Beliefs) that explain WHY a persona holds specific traits and judgments.
 *
 * The generated rationales are appended to the persona's backstory as a
 * <<PSYCHOLOGICAL RATIONALES (PB&J)>> section, creating causal coherence
 * between the Big Five profile and the psychographic spec.
 *
 * Reference: Joshi et al. (2025) "Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization

 *
 * Prompts live here; completions run on LlmServiceImpl (and through it the
 * OpenAI-compatible provider). Internal to the LLM adapter, not a port
 * implementation.
