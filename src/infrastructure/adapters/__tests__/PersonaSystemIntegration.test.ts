  backstory: [
    "I grew up in Detroit, watching the auto industry get disrupted by technology. My father was a line worker who lost his job to automation — that taught me that you either adapt or get left behind. I taught myself to code on a used ThinkPad when I was 14.",
    "After a CS degree from University of Michigan, I joined Amazon as an SDE. Five years there taught me operational rigor but also made me cynical about corporate buzzwords. I left to join a Series A startup as their first engineering hire. We scaled from 5 to 200 engineers before being acquired by Google.",
    "The acquisition was a mixed blessing. I made good money but watched the startup culture I loved get smothered by process. Two years ago I left to become VP Eng at a Series B infrastructure company. We're growing fast but I'm terrified of repeating the same mistakes — too much process kills velocity, too little kills quality.",
    "I once approved a $200k annual DataDog contract that we barely used. My CTO at the time had pushed it through with a flashy demo. I learned to demand proof, not promises. Now I evaluate every tool by: (1) can we start with a small pilot, (2) what's the actual total cost over 3 years, (3) who else in our network has used it.",
    "My office is a controlled chaos. Three monitors, a standing desk that's almost always at sitting height, and a Moleskine notebook where I sketch architecture diagrams. I hate wasted space and wasted motion. Design-wise I prefer brutalist aesthetics — honest materials, no ornamentation."
