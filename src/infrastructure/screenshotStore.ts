/**
 * Shared in-memory screenshot store for VPS pricing analysis.
 * Screenshots are large base64 strings delivered via a side-channel store
 * rather than the initial response body.
 * Separated from getScreenshot.ts (a "use server" file) so that VPS API routes
 * can import it directly — "use server" modules can only export async functions.
 *
 * Stored on globalThis to survive Next.js HMR (same pattern as progressStore.ts).
