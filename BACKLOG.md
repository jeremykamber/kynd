## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 4: Behavioral Simulation & UX Flow
- [ ] **Agentic Browser Interaction**: Implement the persona-driven browser agent from the design doc — custom agent loop on top of Stagehand `act()`/`extract()`/`observe()` with persona anchor injection between steps, structured step-by-step narrative output, and emotional reflection tracking
- [ ] **Persona Browser Agent: Production Hardening**: Error recovery, timeout handling, session persistence, multi-page navigation, CDP/remote browser support

### Pricing Analysis
- [ ] **Pricing Analysis OMO Fixes**: Address issues identified in the pricing page analysis plan — edge cases in non-streaming flow, analysis quality improvements, error state handling

---

## 🚀 Performance (P1)

Pipeline instrumentation and optimization. Persona generation and simulation analysis both take 1 minute+. These issues are ordered — #43 (instrumentation) should land first so the rest have data behind them.

- [ ] **#43 — Instrument pipelines with wall-clock timing**: Add elapsed-time logging to every phase boundary in `GeneratePersonasUseCase` and `ParsePricingPageUseCase`. Log call counts, retry events, and batch vs. fallback paths. Output a summary timeline at the end of each pipeline run.
- [ ] **#44 — Cache browser screenshots and HTML**: In-memory cache on VPS keyed by URL + viewport + locale. Skip Playwright navigation on repeat analyses. ~5-10s saved per cache hit.
- [ ] **#45 — Merge persona generation phases incrementally**: Combine backstories + insights into one call (safe first step), then evaluate merging PB&J scaffolds (1 call per persona instead of 3). Do not merge all four phases at once — measure each change.
- [ ] **#46 — Benchmark simulation concurrency**: Test p-limit values of 5, 7, 10, 12 for persona analysis. Plot the knee of the curve. Set to measured optimal, not guessed optimal.
- [ ] **#47 — Reduce JSON parse failures and retries**: Measure batch backstory/insight parse failure rates. Add JSON repair before retry. Improve prompt-level JSON reliability.

## 📋 TODO (Future Phases)

### Phase 3: Deep Evaluation & Refinement (P2)
- [ ] **Economic Environment Toggles** (P2): Simulate Recession vs. Growth conditions — interesting but far-term, not blocking current work
- [ ] **Comparative Perspective View** (P2): Side-by-side comparison of persona views — still wanted but needs redesigned format

### Phase 5: Team Collaboration & Reporting
- [ ] Branded PDF Export (Refinement)
- [ ] Unified Cohort Reports
- [ ] Team Workspaces
- [ ] Stakeholder Annotations

### Phase 6: Integration & Ecosystem
- [ ] CRM / Segment Integration
- [ ] CI/CD Pricing Audit CLI
- [ ] Chrome Extension
- [ ] Webhooks

---

### Observability & Debugging (P3)
- [ ] **Client-Side Log Sink**: Lightweight `ClientLogger` that mirrors `console.log` calls to a `POST /api/vps/client-logs` endpoint, appending client-side trace events (cancel, polling, stream arrival) into the per-run `AnalysisLogger` JSONL file
- [ ] **Log Viewer Page**: Admin UI at `/admin/logs/{runId}` to read and search per-run structured logs without SSH access
- [ ] **Log Level Configuration**: `LOG_LEVEL` env var to suppress TRACE/DEBUG in production while keeping the instrumentation in place for when it's needed

## Priority Key

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Blocking — must do now |
| **P1** | This sprint / next sprint |
| **P2** | This quarter |
| **P3** | Backlog — revisit later |
